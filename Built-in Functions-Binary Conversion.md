# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```

## Output
<img width="385" height="305" alt="517425138-a4806adc-6702-4908-a123-e3aa65423a1a" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7774c98f-8ce7-4ece-bc20-23f5a35f261e" />

## Result
Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully.
